	<p>
	In this pop-up window you can book a new room. You just have to choose between "Double" (2 people) or "Familiar" (4 People) room, and between inside or outside cabin.
	You may choose also some extras. And you have to enter the age of each person on the room, and add them. (Please take into account that extra beds are only available for people under 16).
