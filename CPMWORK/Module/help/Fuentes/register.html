	<h1>Register</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>
	In this step you must introduce your personal details. Please take into account that Name, Surname, ID and Phone are mandatory fields. 
	
	You can continue without registering, in that way your user won't be saved for another time. If you want to save your user, you must introduce a password. (An email is recommended just in case of password loss).
	Now you can login.
