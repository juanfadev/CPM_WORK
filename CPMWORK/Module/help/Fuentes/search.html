	<p>
	To search a cruise you must enter the dates (before and after) you want your cruise to start, and the area. If you leave any of them empty, it is supposed to be the maximum or minimum date possible.
	
	Take into account that a list of cruises may appear. They have several fields. The starting point, the duration (in days), the visited cities and the starting date.
	
	You may select the most appropiate one for you. If later on, you want to change cruise, you only have to go back to search.
